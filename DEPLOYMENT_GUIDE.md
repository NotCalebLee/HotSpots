       "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
     },
     "homepage": "https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME"
   }
   ```

4. **Deploy:**

## 📝 Quick Start (Vercel - Recommended)

# 1. Build your site (already done!)
npm run build

# 2. Install Vercel globally
npm install -g vercel

# 3. Login (opens browser)
vercel login

# 4. Deploy!
vercel

# 5. For production deployment:
vercel --prod
```

**That's it!** You'll get a URL in seconds! 🎉

## 🔧 Your Build is Ready!

Your production build is already in the `dist` folder. This folder contains:

- ✅ Optimized HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- ✅ Compressed assets
- ✅ Your logo and images
- ✅ Interactive heatmap files

**Total size:** ~300 KB (very fast!)

---

## 🌐 What You'll Get

After deployment, your website will have:

- ✅ **Custom URL** (e.g., hotspots.vercel.app)
- ✅ **HTTPS** (secure, padlock in browser)
- ✅ **Global CDN** (fast worldwide)
- ✅ **Automatic updates** (deploy new versions easily)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Custom Domain:** After deploying, you can add your own domain (like hotspots.com) in your hosting dashboard

2. **Environment Variables:** For the heatmap HTML files to work, make sure they're in the `public` folder (they already are!)

3. **Updates:** To update your site:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   vercel --prod
   ```

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you run into issues:

1. Make sure all files are saved
2. Check that `dist` folder exists after `npm run build`
3. Verify the heatmap HTML files are in the `public` folder
4. Check the terminal for any error messages
